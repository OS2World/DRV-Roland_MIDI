Information About The C Users Journal and C Users' Group
--------------------------------------------------------

This file contains information About The C Users Journal ("CUJ") and
C Users' Group.  If you are interested in subscribing, submitting
proposals or articles for publication in CUJ, or contributing your
Public Domain software to the C Users' Group library, please read on.


The C Users Journal:
-------------------

The C Users Journal is written by sophisticated programmers for
sophisticated programmers.  We insist on practical treatments of real
programming problems, or on tutorials that make theory or complex issues
more accessible to practicing programmers.  In place of product reviews,
we publish user reports that show -- with insight backed by experience
-- how to use commercial products that aid the program developer.  Our
emphasis is on C and C++, or on tools used in conjunction with these
languages.

Each issue of The C Users Journal gives you tips and tricks you can use
right away.  Only a limited number of magazines are printed, though - in
fact, some popular issues are already out of print.  Subscribe today!
For only $29.95 you'll receive 12 issues of timesaving, practical
programming information.  Call 913-841-1631 to reserve the next issue.

The C Users Journal is the successor to the C Users' Group Newsletter
and the C Journal.  Subscribers are automatically enrolled as members of
the C Users' Group.  The C Users Journal and The C Users' Group are
services of R&D Publications, Inc., Lawrence, KS.

Back issues and quantity reprints of selected articles are available.
If you have an idea for an article and experience that would qualify you
to write for other programmers, please request authors's guidelines from
       The C Users Journal
       1601 W. 23rd St, Suite 200
       P.O. Box 3127
       Lawrence, KS 66046
       (913) 841-1631.

We pay at rates that are competitive with other national technical
journals.  We believe that our editorial assistance is better than most.
You don't have to be a professional writer to meet our acceptance
criteria, but you must have something to say.

A proposal consists of a brief abstract and outline, preferably totaling
no more than one page, and a brief resume of your qualifications.  When
mailing the proposal, please include a hard copy and an ASCII text file
on an MS-DOS formatted disk.
You MUST submit your manuscript on an MS-DOS disk.  Files must be in raw
ASCII format, flush left, with one empty line between paragraphs.  Code
should be no wider than 64 columns.  Keep any code as brief as possible
and to the point.  If you ignore any of these requirements you increase
the probability that an otherwise acceptable article will be rejected.

All topics pertinent to advanced programming issues in C and C++ are
appropriate for proposals.  Please see the file CALL.DOC on this disk
for the "Call For Papers" published in the current issue of CUJ.


The C Users' Group:

composed primarily of submission by members.  C programmers are
encouraged to submit software to the Library.  Send software on disk
(no subdirectories on MS-DOS disks please) to The C User's Group,
